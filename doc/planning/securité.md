🔒 Security Analysis of Barades.com
✅ Strong Security Implementations
Authentication & Authorization:

✅ Argon2 password hashing - Industry-leading, OWASP recommended, memory-hard algorithm resistant to GPU attacks (better than bcrypt)
✅ JWT tokens with 1-hour expiration
✅ JWT_SECRET properly stored in environment variables
✅ Guards on all sensitive endpoints (JwtAuthGuard + OptionalJwtAuthGuard)
✅ Generic error messages for login failures (prevents user enumeration attacks)
✅ 12-character minimum password requirement (OWASP compliant)
Data Protection:

✅ Prisma ORM protects against SQL injection
✅ class-validator for input validation on DTOs
✅ TypeScript type safety throughout
✅ CORS configured with origin whitelist
✅ Row Level Security (RLS) scripts prepared for PostgreSQL
✅ Service role key properly isolated (backend only, never client-side)
Architecture:

✅ Separation of concerns - Frontend never accesses database directly
✅ Authorization checks before sensitive operations
✅ Validated DTOs with whitelist/transform enabled
⚠️ Security Gaps & Recommendations
Critical Missing Features:

❌ No rate limiting on authentication endpoints (vulnerable to brute force)
❌ No Helmet middleware for HTTP security headers
❌ No CSRF protection
❌ No input sanitization against XSS attacks
❌ No refresh tokens (only 1h access tokens)
❌ No email verification on signup
❌ No 2FA option
Development vs Production Concerns:

⚠️ CORS allows all origins in development (origin: true)
⚠️ HTTPS not enforced (needs production configuration)
⚠️ No security monitoring/audit logs
⚠️ LocalStorage for JWT (vulnerable to XSS - HttpOnly cookies would be better)
📊 Security Score: 7/10
Strengths:

Excellent authentication foundation
Modern password hashing
Proper database abstraction
Type-safe codebase
Weaknesses:

Missing production hardening (rate limiting, Helmet, HTTPS enforcement)
No advanced features (2FA, email verification, refresh tokens)
Limited attack surface protection
JWT storage could be more secure
🛡️ Priority Recommendations
High Priority (Before Production):

Add rate limiting (@nestjs/throttler)
Install Helmet for security headers
Enable HTTPS enforcement
Restrict CORS to specific domains
Add input sanitization
Medium Priority: 6. Implement refresh tokens 7. Add email verification 8. Move JWT to HttpOnly cookies 9. Add audit logging 10. Implement CSRF protection

Low Priority (Nice to Have): 11. Add 2FA support 12. Penetration testing 13. Security monitoring dashboard 14. Regular dependency updates

💡 Conclusion
Barades.com has a solid security foundation suitable for an academic TFE project, with professional-grade authentication using Argon2 and JWT. However, it's not production-ready without adding rate limiting, security headers, and proper HTTPS configuration. For a student project, it demonstrates good security awareness, but real-world deployment would require the additional hardening measures listed above.
